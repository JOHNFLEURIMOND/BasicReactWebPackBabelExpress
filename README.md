# My Awesome Project
Starwars films and Character App
# How It's Made :nut_and_bolt:üî® :hammer::wrench::


## Assignment:
 In the following two slides, you see a rough sketch of a web app made for Star Wars fans. Your mission is to implement this functionality in a React app. The implementation must be responsive and should adapt itself to the screen sizes of mobile/desktop. 

With this assignment, I was to create a app with landing page with a list of all the Star Wars Films. When the Film is selected, you are then routed to another page rendering on a list of the characters from selected film.

## Data:
 You will fetch the StarWars data from the public API https://swapi.dev/

## State Management: 
Please use React Hooks and/or Redux as deemed necessary.

## Assets: 
In the slides, we see a logo and a background. You are free to use the images that are in these slides or just search for ‚Äústar wars logo‚Äù and ‚Äústars background‚Äù. The final app does not need to follow the same ( ugly :) ) design as in this file. You are most welcome to modify the design as you like, as long as the dynamic behaviour is correctly implemented.  We would like you to use Material UI for the look-and-feel https://material-ui.com/ 

## Layout: 
If the screen is wide, use a grid layout to show the list in multiple columns 

## Coding Style:
As for coding style, we follow the Airbnb guidelines  https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

# How To Get It Started :arrow_forward: :

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run dev`

To get the app started, cd into folder and run `npm run dev` after running `build` command


Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run prettier`
This corrects the format.
